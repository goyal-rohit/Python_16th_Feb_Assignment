    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, and scalability. Here are some key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model:\n",
    "SQL databases use a relational data model, where data is stored in tables with predefined columns and relationships between tables. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a non-relational data model, which can take various forms, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, or graph databases. NoSQL databases typically offer more flexible data modeling and can handle semi-structured or unstructured data better than SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language:\n",
    "SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) as a standard language for querying and manipulating data. SQL is a declarative language that uses predefined commands to retrieve data from tables, join tables together, and perform complex operations. NoSQL databases, however, use different query languages depending on the type of database. For example, document-oriented databases may use JSON-based queries, while key-value stores may use simple key-based queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability:\n",
    "SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, which means that they require larger hardware resources (e.g., more CPU, RAM, or storage) to handle increased traffic or data volume. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are horizontally scalable, which means that they can distribute data across multiple servers or nodes to improve performance and handle more traffic or data volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ACID Compliance:\n",
    "SQL databases are typically ACID-compliant, which means that they ensure that transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. This ensures data consistency and reliability but may also affect performance. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, may offer different levels of consistency and durability, depending on the database type and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, SQL databases are better suited for applications that require strict data consistency, complex data relationships, and transactions, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require flexible data modeling, high scalability, and handling of large amounts of unstructured data.\n",
